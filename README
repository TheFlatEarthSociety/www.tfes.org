This repository contains a standard BlazeBlogger directory hierarchy,
except:

  .blaze
    This is a symlink to ., in order for BlazeBlogger data to appear
    directly in the root of the repository.

  Makefile
    This contains convenience make targets for deployment.

  log
  public/
    These are both in .gitignore. The former is a log written by
    BlazeBlogger which is pointless when we have git commit history; the
    latter is where the 'blaze' make target generates its content.

  static/
    This directory is for static content not managed by BlazeBlogger. The
    'blaze' make target will copy it into public/ as is.
