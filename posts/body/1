<p>I am proud to announce the birth of a new Flat Earth Society, the
latest in a long succession of Societies which traces its roots back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Rowbotham">Samuel Rowbotham
</a> in the nineteenth century. A man with a keen sense of adventure and
unparalleled will to question established wisdom, Rowbotham developed the
foundation for modern Flat Earth Theory in his renowned book, <a
href="http://library.tfes.org/library/samuel_rowbotham_-_earth_not_a_globe.pdf">
<i>Earth, Not a Globe</i></a>, published in 1865.</p>

<p>Next year will be the 150th anniversary of this groundbreaking work,
and Flat Earth Theory is still as strong as ever. This website exists as
a breeding ground for zetetic wisdom; a place to foster new ideas and
challenge old ones. Regardless of whether you agree with our philosophy
or not, we welcome you to debate with us on our forum, and hope that in
doing so you will broaden your mind and help to broaden ours.</p>

<p>As other Flat Earth Societies which have come and gone before us, we
aim to carry forward the tradition of being untraditional; to push past
the boundaries we impose upon ourselves and discover new truth in doing
so. We hope you will join us on the path to enlightenment.</p>

<p>IN VERITATE VICTORIA!</p>
