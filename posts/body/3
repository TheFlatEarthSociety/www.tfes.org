<p>It's 2015, and the future sure feels great! Lots of new and exciting things
are happening at the Flat Earth Society as we herald in the new year. In 2014 we
took great strides in the advancement of the Flat Earth Theory through discussion,
debate, and experimentation. Our "global" cause lives on as strong and proud as 
ever.</p>

<p>2015 marks the sesquicentennial of the release of the second edition of
<a href="http://wiki.tfes.org/Samuel_Rowbotham">Samuel Rowbotham</a>'s
<em>Zetetic Astronomy</em>. The second edition expanded the original 16-page
pamphlet into a detailed and substantial book henceforth known as <a
href=http://library.tfes.org/library/samuel_rowbotham_-_earth_not_a_globe.pdf">
<em>Earth Not a Globe!</em></a> It was these stones of knowledge that laid the
foundations on which we built the towers of learning.</p>

<p>To celebrate this anniversary, we obtained a copy of the original 1849 pamphlet
from the Library of Congress. It is our pleasure to announce that this once-obscure
resource is now <strong><a
href="http://library.tfes.org/library/samuel_rowbotham_-_zetetic_astronomy_1ed.pdf">
available free of charge from our Flat Earth Library!</a></strong>

<p>In humbler news, 2015 looks to be the year of unification for the world's two
most influential Flat Earth Societies. After much debate, we've agreed to reunite
with our sister society at
<a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org">theflatearthsociety.org</a>.
The merging of these two communities would never have happened without the diligent
work done in 2014. More details about the merger can be found
<a href="http://forum.tfes.org/index.php?topic=2191.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether living rimward or hubward, we all look forward to the exciting
challenges and accomplishments that 2015 will bring to The Flat Earth Society.</p>
